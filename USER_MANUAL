In today's era of smart technology, sustainable gardening and efficient plant care are more important than ever. Traditional watering methods are often inconsistent, leading to overwatering, underwatering, and inefficient water use. These practices not only waste resources but also risk damaging plant health. To address this issue, we present an Automated Water Sprinkler System integrated with humidity, temperature, and moisture sensors — a smart, user-centered solution designed to optimize plant watering based on real-time environmental data.

The goal of this innovation is to create a system that responds automatically to the specific needs of plants, minimizing user effort while maximizing effectiveness. Using the User-Centered System Design (UCSD) approach, we focused on designing a system that is intuitive, responsive, and adaptable. The system continuously gathers data from the surrounding environment and activates the sprinkler only when necessary, ensuring optimal soil moisture levels and supporting healthy plant growth.

This product benefits a wide range of users — from home gardeners and greenhouse managers to agricultural hobbyists — by automating a critical gardening task and giving users more control through real-time monitoring and smart adjustments. With this system, plant care becomes more efficient, more sustainable, and more accessible.
